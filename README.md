# Qld JVM Talks

Talk ideas for meetups, see the meetup group at http://www.meetup.com/qldjvm.

We encourage you to create issues for talk ideas you think would be interesting, would like to see or would like to talk about.  Go to the issue you'd like to see and add a comment with +1 or :+1:.  Volunteer yourself or (better yet) someone else to do the talk by adding a comment.
